Is Mr. Incredible stronger than the Hulk? Is Yoda a better fighter than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Use this Superhero Team Picker app to build your ideal team of heroes, (or villains) and see how they rank against each other. Superheros can be filtered by their alias, and teams can be persisted in local storage.
